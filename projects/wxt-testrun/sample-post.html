<h3>Executive summary</h3>

<p>
In September 2016, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (the Secretariat) launched an informal consultation exercise to seek opinion, ideas, feedback and best practices on the topic of digital government.
</p>
<p>
Feedback and insights were collected in the form of in-person and web-hosted interactive sessions and discussions, bilateral meetings with a note taker present to capture what was said, social media posts and comments (hashtag: #GCDigital) and email submissions. Comments, ideas and questions were categorized by theme for presentation in this report.
</p>

<div class="heading-container">
	<h2>
		<span class="wrap">
			<span class="inner">Why Digital Government?</span>
		</span>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Advances in digital technology have raised the bar in terms of what citizens expect when it comes to customer service.&nbsp; Financial institutions allow us to quickly check balances, transfer funds or pay a bill via mobile apps. Online retail offers more selection, at home delivery on demand, and easy returns. Uber and Lyft have disrupted the traditional notions of transportation options, how we access transportation services, and how we pay for them. In a new digital era where citizens&rsquo; expectations of services are rapidly increasing, governments must also rise to the challenge. Citizens expect that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an app for that,&rdquo; while all too often the response from government is still &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a form for that&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) <a href="http://www.oecd.org/gov/digital-government/Recommendation-digital-government-strategies.pdf">defines Digital Government</a> as:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><em>&ldquo;the rethinking of government policy, program and service delivery through digital enablers, as an integrated part of governments&rsquo; modernization strategies, to create public value. It relies on and enables an ecosystem that connects government, non-governmental organizations, businesses, citizens&rsquo; associations and individuals to support the production of and access to data, services and content through interactions with the government.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scope of Digital Government extends beyond that of electronic service delivery and self-service channels. It touches every facet of how governments are managed, and how we engage our citizens and stakeholders &ndash; by using relevant digital advances to drive measurable efficiency, effectiveness, and benefits to citizens. Furthermore, it applies key principles of open government, open dialogue, client-centricity, co-creation, and accountability. In the long run, successful Digital Government efforts can help build stronger engagement and trust between citizens and governments.</p>

<p>While Canada was regarded as a world leader in the first wave of bringing government services online in the late 1990s and early 2000s, over the past decade our progress has slowed compared to other countries; in the recently released 2016 UN E-Government rankings Canada slipped another 3 places to 14<sup>th</sup> overall in the world. The <a href="http://oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201311_02_e_38796.html">2013 Fall Report of the OAG on Access to Online Services</a> also painted a picture of a disjointed and inefficient GC-wide approach to the delivery of digital services. While a strengthened government-wide Policy on Service and departmental initiatives to improve service delivery have helped address some of these issues, collective, consistent efforts need to be accelerated.</p>

<p>Size, scope and complexity can slow government efforts to transform and respond to changing priorities and service expectations and to take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by digital advances. Access to the right digital talent and the capacity to attract, retain and leverage our internal digitally skilled workforce contributes to this struggle to respond. To be successful and to remain relevant, the government will have to be more flexible and agile to better exploit the potential of digital in rethinking service design and delivery. This is not about procuring the latest technology or redesigning websites or on-line services &ndash; it is about liberating creativity, looking from the outside-in to embed user-centric innovation in how we &ldquo;do&rdquo; government, and better harnessing new technology, skills and new sources of talent.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about using agile development methodologies that combine iterative work cycles, prototyping approaches, and strong feedback loops throughout the development process to better respond to unpredictability. Importantly it&rsquo;s also about leadership and attitude and challenging convention, and creating space for experimentation.</p>

<h3>Digital government around the world</h3>

<p>Governments worldwide and at every level are facing similar issues around digital transformation capacity. Many countries (e.g. US, UK, Australia, Denmark, Singapore) have created digital strategies to better leverage digital opportunities in support of client needs and expectations (See Annex A for further details on these examples). Some jurisdictions have also responded by creating a central digital services organization that focus on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>User-centric service innovation</li>
	<li>Capacity to prototype and quickly develop digital solutions to problems</li>
	<li>Transforming procurement to more effectively implement modern technologies</li>
	<li>Better use of data to improve services and drive results</li>
</ul>

<p>Activities of different digital services offices vary both in terms of scope and maturity. A scan of what other jurisdictions are doing reveals:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The UK launched the <strong>Government Digital Service</strong> in 2011 to make services simpler, faster, clearer and digital by default. It made waves by working in full view of the public, and by using open source software and enlisting award-winning design expertise. GDS has also played a central role in managing IT spending across the UK government, reforming procurement systems for IT, and assessing The GDS is a separate unit of the Cabinet Office with 500+ staff and a budget of close to $100M.</li>
	<li>New Zealand established the <strong>Digital Transformation (Result 10 &amp; RealMe) Team</strong> in 2013 to work with agencies to adopt a user-centric approach and to deliver simpler, seamless, end-to-end services around important life events. A unit of the Department of Interior Affairs (CIO&rsquo;s Office), it has a budget of $3.2M CAD.</li>
	<li>The US established <strong>18F</strong> in 2014 along with the <strong>US Digital Service</strong> to help transform the federal government&rsquo;s IT efforts and improve public-facing digital services. While the US Digital Service (98 staff, growing to 500 embedded throughout different departments) sits within the Executive Office of the President, the more project-based 18F (Technology Transformation Service) operates as a cost-recovery model as part of the Government Services Agency and has approximately 200 staff. Both teams use open source software extensively and recruit talent from Silicon Valley technology start-ups. The US digital offices have also done significant work on procurement processes to allow for open source approaches and participation of smaller companies.</li>
	<li>The Australian government established the <strong>Digital Transformation Agency</strong> (previously the Digital Transformation Office) in 2015 to work with agencies to invest in technology that underpins digital services, and to lead the transformation of government services to deliver a better experience for Australians. Initially led by a former Director from GDS in the UK, the DTA is within the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office and has approximately 100 staff and a budget of just over $90M CAD. The DTA jump-started its work by adopting design standards and tools directly from GDS in the UK.</li>
	<li>Other governments have accomplished some significant, and in some cases ground breaking, progress, such as Estonia&rsquo;s <strong>e-Estonia</strong> Digital Society initiative. Estonia&rsquo;s digital infrastructure &ndash; including a citizen e-ID system, digital signatures, and X-road, a secure data exchange layer used by banks, other businesses, and public services alike &ndash; has a level of security and reliability that is unmatched around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, in Canada, Ontario has also created a <strong>Digital Government Team </strong>within the Cabinet Office to lead the strategic implementation of the government&rsquo;s digital agenda and drive government-wide transformation. Ontario also now has a Minister responsible for Digital Government, and a Deputy Minister-level position of Chief Digital Officer is also being established. There have also been examples at the municipal level in Canada of focused digital strategies and organizational reform, such as in Vancouver with the creation of a Chief Digital Officer to drive digital transformation across the municipal government or the City of Calgary&rsquo;s launch of its digital strategy in 2014.</p>

<p>In Canada, the activities that are being conducted by central digital service offices in other countries are dispersed throughout the system and generally at lower levels of maturity. While TBS plays an oversight role on large IT investments and sets overall direction on service standards and the use of IT, ultimately it has been up to departments to determine how they use and incorporate technology or adopt digital approaches to support service delivery. This has led to a patchwork of different approaches and less than strategic direction, particularly when it comes to applying user-centric approaches to service delivery and agile methodologies to prototyping and incorporating user feedback throughout the service development process. With recent commitments by the government to improve service delivery for Canadians, the time was right to start exploring what a Made-in-Canada approach to digital government should look like.</p>




<div class="heading-container">
	<h2>
		<span class="wrap">
			<span class="inner">Starting a Conversation on a Made-in-Canada Approach</span>
		</span>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Beginning in September 2016, a newly formed Digital Service Innovation team at Treasury Board Secretariat began designing and undertaking a series of expert consultations on digital government, soliciting perspectives on the topic from numerous stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds to inform an emerging Government of Canada approach to improving digital service delivery. While not designed to be a broad citizen consultation in the traditional sense, this exercise was shaped to reach out to learn from the experience of other jurisdictions as well as gather input from stakeholders across the country related to technology and service delivery.</p>
<p><strong>In total, 20 cities and 10 provinces and territories were visited by members of the TBS Digital Service Innovation team between September 2016 and January 2017.</strong> During this time, discussions took place with over 1000 individuals representing both more than 200 different organizations as well as in some cases individual expert views on digital government. These discussions largely took place with stakeholders that can be classified into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provincial and municipal government organizations</li>
<li>Technology sector companies, entrepreneurs, and incubators/accelerators</li>
<li>Civic Tech organizations, communities, and non-profits</li>
<li>Academic institutions and students</li>
</ul>

<p>Feedback and input was also received in other formats such as via email, bilateral discussions, tweets using the #GCDigital hashtag, and networking events. In addition, during this period discussions were also held with international peers from a number of countries whom have been engaged in digital transformation initiatives over the past few years. These conversations were not targeted consultations per say, but took advantage of visits by different representatives to Ottawa as well as international events that TBS team members were present at (e.g. OECD E-Leaders meeting in Estonia in September 2016). Comments, ideas and questions from these various discussions with both Canadian stakeholders and international counterparts were captured informally to assist in the creation of this report.</p>
<p>A standard presentation was used to spark discussion while meeting with stakeholders across the country as part of these expert consultations (See Annex B). Four major themes were presented in the framing of these discussions, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organizing to Deliver Digital</li>
<li>Digital Talent</li>
<li>Digital Service Design and Delivery</li>
<li>Putting in Place the Right Foundations</li>
</ul>

<p>While different conversations had different focuses depending on the stakeholders present, these four themes captured the key areas of interest to us in these discussions. The remainder of this report is structured along these themes to explore what we heard in our engagement that will help us to inform a path forward for a Made-in-Canada approach to Digital Government.</p>



<div class="heading-container">

			<span class="inner">Organizing to Deliver Digital</span>
		</span>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>Which jurisdictions and industries are &ldquo;doing digital&rdquo; successfully and what can we learn from their experience? How can we best organize for digital transformation? What are the potential barriers to building a more digitally-enabled government?</p>
<p>Focus areas for these discussions included: Leadership structures for digital transformation; Digital operations management; Governance and coordination with other jurisdictions.</p>

<h3>Key Themes from What We Heard:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
	Need for strong, central leadership
	<ul>
		<li>international examples of political leadership (both good and bad aspects of having this cover)</li>
		<li>domestics examples in Ontario, Vancouver, Calgary, etc.</li>
		<li>overcoming institutional inertia</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	Finding the right balance between disruption and evolution
	<ul>
		<li>balancing off the need to both change the organization and work with client departments to get things done</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	Evolving role of the Chief Information Officer
	<ul>
		<li>emerging CDO role - what does that mean for CIOs</li>
		<li>Becoming a strategic business partner rather than simply keeping the lights on</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	Working in the open to accelerate change with all jurisdictions
	<ul>
		<li>lots of moving pieces and the need to accelerate change</li>
		<li>too many players to coordinate effectively in a closed manner</li>
		<li>ability for open source solutions to be repurposed by other jurisdictions</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	Data is critical to improving service delivery, but both policy and perception issues that need to be overcome
</li>
</ol>




<div class="heading-container">
	<h2>
		<span class="wrap">
			<span class="inner">Digital Talent</span>
		</span>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>What are the digital skills required today in the public sector? How can we attract and retain the necessary digital talent in government? What are the barriers for women and other under-represented groups working in IT? How can we collaborate with world-class expertise in fields critical to the use of new digital approaches?</p>

<p>Focus areas for these discussions included: Recruitment and retention of employees with digital skills, and building digital capacity through training.</p>
<h3>Key Themes from What We Heard:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Government is a black-box when it comes to recruitment from the outside - need to find better ways to connect external talent and internal opportunities</li>

	<li>Many in tech sector are mission-driven - not looking for 30yr career but want impact - short-term tours of duty, flexibility</li>

	<li>Engage with design and digital talent in universities differently and earlier - GC approach is far behind competitors in the tech sector going for the same talent pool</li>


	<li>There is an emerging “third-way” between simply build or buy - co-creation opportunities</li>


	<li>Need to work in different ways - not just have to come to Ottawa / innovation outposts</li>

</ol>




<div class="heading-container">
	<h2>
		<span class="wrap">
			<span class="inner">Digital Service Design and Delivery</span>
		</span>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>How can we better design and deliver digital services from a user-centred perspective? Is change required with regard to governance, processes, and organizational culture to ensure a more user-centric approach? How do we measure success in digital service delivery? </p>
<p>Focus areas for these discussions included: Delivering experimental prototypes and pilot projects; Agile, iterative, and scalable approaches to development; User-centred improvement and customization of digital solutions; User research, design thinking, and usability.</p>

<h3>Key Themes from What We Heard:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>User needs to be at the centre of all service design - lots of implications of this</li>
	<li>Iterative approaches are critical to success, but hard to fit into existing govt processes</li>
	<li>Digital Design standards can drive change across the system, but they also need to be tailored to the Canadian context: Accessibility, low-bandwidth access (rural &amp; north), Official Languages</li>
	<li>The sweet spot between design thinking and digital - ripe area to explore</li>
	<li>Need for someone to play a central role in scaling innovation, connecting the dots</li>
</ol>


<div class="heading-container">
	<h2>
		<span class="wrap">
			<span class="inner">Putting in Place the Right Foundations</span>

</div>

<p>What IT infrastructure is needed to support government collaboration and interoperability with provinces, territories, municipalities, not-for-profits, academia, businesses, and citizens? How can the Government of Canada build on the approaches described in the GC IT Strategy and supporting Cloud Adoption Strategy?</p>
<p>Focus areas for these discussions included: Digital infrastructure; Enterprise digital identity and standards; Procurement modernization.</p>

<h3>Key Themes from What We Heard:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Procurement continues to be a challenge - how do we bite of small, agile pieces?</li>
	<li>Cloud and open source become key building blocks to digital innovation</li>
	<li>Digital Identity is key building block needed to enable better digital service across boundaries</li>
	<li>Broader digital literacy needed within government to ensure better decision-making</li>
</ol>
